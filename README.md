# LSB-Steganography

Luis Suarez Bites!!!
Get your pillows ready !! Tried using different modules in python ?
Luis Suarez Bits can be used to hide s3cr3t t3xt :)
# Usage :
text_to_hide = "This is a secret message."
image_path = "image.png"

 Encoding the text into the image:
encoded_image_path = encode_text_into_image(image_path, text_to_hide)
print(f"Text hidden in image: {encoded_image_path}")

 Decoding the hidden text from the image:
decoded_text = decode_text_from_image(encoded_image_path)
print(f"Decoded text: {decoded_text}")
